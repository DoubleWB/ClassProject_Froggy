-------------

You assume the body of a young frog named Froggo.

The object of the game is to eat all other frogs
on the screen without being eaten.

If Froggo is bigger than another frog, he will eat it,
otherwise, he will be eaten himself and the game will end.

Once Froggo becomes the largest frog in the swamp, the game ends in
victory.


Control Froggo by clicking the location you wish him to travel to.

The further away from Froggo you click, the faster he will travel.

If Froggo goes to the left or right boundary, he will appear on the other side.

If Froggo goes to the top or bottom boundary, he will stop at that boundary.

Good luck!
